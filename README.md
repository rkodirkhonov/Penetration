  - Android: Install GameGuardian on a rooted device from [GameGuardian](https://gameguardian.net/download)

## 2. Setup and Configuration

### 2.1. Decompile the APK
Use APKTool to decompile the APK file:
```
apktool d <app_name>.apk -o <output_directory>
```
### 2.2. View Decompiled Code
Use JADX to view the decompiled Java source code:
```
jadx-gui <app_name>.apk2.3.
```
Intercept Network TrafficConfigure Burp Suite or Charles Proxy to capture and analyze network traffic. Set up your device or emulator to use the proxy and install the Burp Suite CA certificate if necessary.
### 2.4. Inspect Local StorageUse ADB to pull local storage files (databases, shared preferences):
```
adb pull /data/data/<package_name>/databases/ <local_directory>
```
Use SQLite Browser to inspect and modify these files.
### 2.5. Dynamic Analysis with FridaUse Frida to hook into the app and modify its behavior.
```
frida -U -f <package_name> -l <script.js> --no-pause
```
### 2.6. Memory Editing (optional)Use GameGuardian or Cheat Engine to modify the app's memory values directly.

### 3. Conducting the Analysis
#### 3.1. Identify Key Functions and Data HandlingLook for methods in the decompiled code that manage coins and diamonds.
#### 3.2. Monitor and Modify Network Traffic Use Burp Suite to capture API calls related to in-game transactions. Modify and replay these requests to test for vulnerabilities.
#### 3.3. Modify Local Data Edit the SQLite databases or shared preferences files to change the values of coins and diamonds.

#### 3.4. Use Frida for Runtime ModificationsInject scripts to alter the behavior of functions managing in-game currency.

### 4. Documentation and Reporting

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for conducting a penetration test on the DLS24 application, focusing on finding ways to manipulate in-game currencies such as coins and diamonds.

## 1. Install Necessary Tools and Applications

For both Windows and Mac, you will need to install the following tools:

### 1.1. Java Development Kit (JDK)
Necessary for running tools like JADX.
- **Download from:** [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)

### 1.2. APKTool
Used for decompiling and recompiling APK files.
- **Installation:**
  - Windows: Download the jar file and place it in a directory. Add this directory to your system's PATH.
  - Mac: Use Homebrew to install (`brew install apktool`).
- **Download from:** [APKTool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/)

### 1.3. JADX
Used to decompile APK files to Java source code.
- **Installation:**
  - Windows and Mac: Download the standalone version and unzip it to a desired location.
- **Download from:** [JADX](https://github.com/skylot/jadx)

### 1.4. Burp Suite
Used for intercepting and analyzing network traffic.
- **Installation:**
  - Windows and Mac: Download the installer and follow the installation instructions.
- **Download from:** [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload)

### 1.5. Frida
Used for dynamic analysis and code injection.
- **Installation:**
  - Windows and Mac: Install via Python's pip (`pip install frida-tools`).
- **Download from:** [Frida](https://frida.re/)

### 1.6. SQLite Browser
Used to inspect and modify SQLite databases.
- **Installation:**
  - Windows and Mac: Download and install the appropriate version for your OS.
- **Download from:** [SQLite Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)

### 1.7. Android Debug Bridge (ADB)
Used for interacting with Android devices.
- **Installation:**
  - Windows and Mac: Download the SDK Platform Tools and add them to your system's PATH.
- **Download from:** [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)

### 1.8. Android Emulator or Rooted Device
Used to run the application in a controlled environment.
- **Installation:**
  - Windows and Mac: Use Android Studio to set up an emulator.
- **Download from:** [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

### 1.9. GameGuardian or Cheat Engine (optional)
Used for memory editing.
- **Installation:**
  - Windows: Download and install Cheat Engine from [Cheat Engine](https://cheatengine.org/)
  - Android: Install GameGuardian on a rooted device from [GameGuardian](https://gameguardian.net/download)

## 2. Setup and Configuration

### 2.1. Decompile the APK
Use APKTool to decompile the APK file:
```
apktool d <app_name>.apk -o <output_directory>
```
### 2.2. View Decompiled Code
Use JADX to view the decompiled Java source code:
```
jadx-gui <app_name>.apk2.3.
```
Intercept Network TrafficConfigure Burp Suite or Charles Proxy to capture and analyze network traffic. Set up your device or emulator to use the proxy and install the Burp Suite CA certificate if necessary.
### 2.4. Inspect Local StorageUse ADB to pull local storage files (databases, shared preferences):
```
adb pull /data/data/<package_name>/databases/ <local_directory>
```
Use SQLite Browser to inspect and modify these files.
### 2.5. Dynamic Analysis with FridaUse Frida to hook into the app and modify its behavior.
```
frida -U -f <package_name> -l <script.js> --no-pause
```
### 2.6. Memory Editing (optional)Use GameGuardian or Cheat Engine to modify the app's memory values directly.
